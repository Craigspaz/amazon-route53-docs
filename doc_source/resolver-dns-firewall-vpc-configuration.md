# DNS Firewall VPC configuration<a name="resolver-dns-firewall-vpc-configuration"></a>

The DNS Firewall configuration for your VPC determines whether Route 53 Resolver allows queries through or blocks them during failures, for example when DNS Firewall is impaired, unresponsive, or not available in the zone\. Resolver enforces a VPC's firewall configuration whenever you have one or more DNS Firewall rule groups associated with the VPC\.

You can configure a VPC to fail open or fail closed\. 
+ By default, the failure mode is closed, which means that Resolver blocks any queries for which it doesn't receive a reply from DNS Firewall and sends a `SERVFAIL` DNS response\. This approach favors security over availability\. 
+ If you enable fail open, Resolver allows queries through if it doesn't receive a reply from DNS Firewall\. This approach favors availability over security\.
